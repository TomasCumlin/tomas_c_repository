The variable CONDA_ENVS_PATH contains the location of your environments. Set it to your project's environments folder if you have one.
Otherwise, the default is ~/.conda/envs. Remember to export the variable with export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/proj/...

You may run "source conda_init.sh" to initialise your shell to be able
to run "conda activate" and "conda deactivate" etc.
Just remember that this command adds stuff to your shell outside the scope of the module system.

REMEMBER TO USE 'conda clean -a' once in a while
